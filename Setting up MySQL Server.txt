After downloading the github folder, you should have a folder called mysql with a data folder and 3 files in it.
In order to get the rest of the database, download the x64 bit version of the 5.7.20 MySQL server community version
standalone from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/  - make sure you get the standalone zip archive, not the installer.

Unzip the file that was downloaded and move all the folders from it into the mysql folder in the github repository.
Note the repository has a .gitignore to prevent pushing any of the files in the mysql folder except those in the root
and data folders.

In order to run the database on its own, open a cmd prompt to the mysql\bin\ directory and run mysqld.exe

To hook up the MySQL server to netbeans, look at the Hooking up MySQL Server with Netbeans.txt in the repository root directory
